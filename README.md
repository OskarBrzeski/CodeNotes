# Code Notes

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault that I use to note down things that I am likely to search up whenever I need them.

You can download this vault with the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OskarBrzeski/CodeNotes
```
Then open this folder with Obsidian
